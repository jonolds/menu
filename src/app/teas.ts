    name: 'Earl Grey',
    type: 'Black',
    description: 'A British tea classic, Earl Grey is the most widely enjoyed black tea blend in the world. Earl Grey dates back to the nineteenth century tea trade when Charles Grey, the 2nd Earl Grey, was presented with a gift of Taitaicha—tea scented with citrus blossoms—during his travels in Canton. After Grey returned home, his namesake tea became wildly popular when the tea salons of Europe infused black teas with the essence of the bergamot citrus fruit that grows in Reggio Di Calabria, Italy. Our organic Earl Grey combines robust and fruity Thai black tea with mellow, caramel sweet Yunnan Dian Hong. This original blend perfectly complements the floral high notes of geranium and rose found in our first-pressing bergamot essential oil.'

    name: 'Jasmine',
    type: 'Green',
    description: 'Jasmine tea is the most popular flower-scented tea in East Asia. Its enchanting, unforgettable aroma is created through an artisanal method of tea scenting that dates back more than 800 years. Jasmine blossoms are gathered during midsummer evenings and spread amongst tea leaves over several successive nights. Because dried tea leaves are hygroscopic, they readily absorb floral essences like jasmine. Our Jasmine Green features a base tea grown by our partners at the Xuan En Yisheng Tea Cooperative, which is prized for its high mountain character and elegant sweetness. Refreshingly fragrant, jasmine has been regarded as the perfect digestif tea for centuries.'
